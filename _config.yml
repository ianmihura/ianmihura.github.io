# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Lifelong learner. I'm passionate about technology and the ways stuff gets built. From webapps,
  Smart Contracts, hashing algorithms and servers to cameras, video encoding protocols and animation.
  Studied in many different universities and institutes, from many different people, always
  absorbing their worldview as their skillset. My path is quite a divergent one, which makes me
  skilled in a very wide range of subjects regarding technology. I work only in places where I
  can learn something.
