cv_description: >-
  Lifelong learner. Passionate about technology and the ways stuff gets built. 
  From webapps, deep learning, hashing algorithms, to video encoding protocols 
  and financial markets, my path is quite a divergent one, making me skilled 
  in a wide range of technologies. I tend to work in positions where I can learn. 
  Personality: My main strength is learning on the spot and finding fast solutions. 
  On the other hand, It has been difficult for me to ask for help when I need it.

  Developer & Writer. Welcome to my Home. Here I store stories and other things.
  There's a bit of everything, but don't expect much of anything.
welcome: >-
  You have landed in my Home. What do you seek?
  There isn't much, you see, just what my hands have crafted.
  Please, do come in and look around. Even if it is a humble corner,
  there are things of all sorts. You may yet find that which
  resonates. Make yourself at Home.
