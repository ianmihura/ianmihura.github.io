description: >-
  Lifelong learner. Passionate about technology and the ways stuff gets built. 
  From webapps, deep learning, hashing algorithms, to video encoding protocols 
  and financial markets. My path is quite a divergent one, which makes me skilled 
  in a wide range of technologies. I tend to work in positions where I can learn. 
  Personality: My main strength is learning on the spot and finding fast solutions. 
  On the other hand, It has been difficult for me to ask for help when I need it.
description_short: Developer & SysAdmin. Probably bussy studying.
