            <p>This is a 2 player version of the solitaire called <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/149845/royal-assassin">Royal Assassin</a>. Make sure you understand the solo version before reading this variation.</p>

<h2 id="cards">Cards</h2>

<p>Best played with 2 full decks, can be played with one deck.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>Each player setups up their noble families, similarly to the solo version. In contrast with it, the noble families they present will be their allies rather than their enemies.</p>

<p>During the setup players build up their own reserve pile (stack of cards facing up). The reserve pile is not shared.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the fresh deck and the discard pile are shared.</p>

<h2 id="rounds">Rounds</h2>

<p>Instead of playing one card at a time, each player draws 3 cards from their deck, and plays one card per turn. They play alternatively until they have no more cards in the hand. Then players draw 3 more cards, and so on.</p>

<p>In each turn the player can choose to:</p>

<h2 id="attack">Attack</h2>

<p>To attack enemy’s families the player places a card in an enemy’s family pile. Same general rules as in the solitaire:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only attack cross-color</li>
  <li>Attacks trigger defenses from the reserve pile of the enemy</li>
  <li>Attacks also trigger new attacks from the attacking reserve pile</li>
</ul>

<p>If both players’ piles can attack and defend in the same moment, these happen alternatively, starting with the defense. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Player A attacks K of clubs with a 5 of hearts (from their hand)</li>
  <li>Player B defends with a 3 of clubs (from their reserve pile)</li>
  <li>Player A attacks with a 2 of hearts (from their reserve pile)</li>
  <li>Player B has no more clubs in their reserve pile, they cannot defend</li>
  <li>Player A continues the attack from their reserve pile</li>
</ul>

<p>Revealing cards: Note that attacking and defending can reveal cards in the reserve pile that can attack or defend a different family tree. Players should also alternate their turn to play these cards.</p>

<p>Coincidence: If a card is revealed in the reserve pile that can both defend one of their own and attack another, the player is free to choose what to do.</p>

<p>Royalty vs royalty: Pieces of royalty can kill other pieces of royalty, given that they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The same value, or better</li>
  <li>There are no ongoing attacks (no number cards in front of it)</li>
  <li>The corresponding color</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="defend">Defend</h2>

<p>To defend one of their families, the player places a card in one of the piles. These families don’t need to be under attack to be defended (in contrast with the solitaire version). Also, a defense that exceeds an attack does not wipe away the ongoing attack. Only an exact sum of zero wipes away the pile. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Player B attacks a J of spades with a 2 of hearts (ongoing count: +2).</li>
  <li>Player A defends with a 5 of spades (ongoing count: -3).</li>
  <li>Player B attacks with a 5 of hearts (ongoing count: +2).</li>
  <li>Player A defends with a 2 of spades (ongoing count: 0).</li>
  <li>The attack pile is discarded, leaving the J of spades open.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that the defense has been re-balanced giving a slight advantage to the defender).</p>

<h2 id="other-actions">Other actions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Present royal figures as in the solitaire version</li>
  <li>If nothing else possible, discard to the reserve pile</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shared-and-not-shared">Shared and not shared</h2>

<p>Players share a discard pile and a deck to draw new cards from.</p>

<p>Players do not share a reserve deck (face-up pile to place unusable cards, and draw defenses/attackers from) nor Jokers.</p>

<h2 id="endgame">Endgame</h2>

<p>The player to completely wipe the other player wins.</p>

<p>Depleting the stockpile is not an endgame condition. If there are no more cards to draw from, the players must re-shuffle the discard pile and draw from it.</p>
