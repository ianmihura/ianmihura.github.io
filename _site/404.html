<title>Ian Home | Lifelong learner. Passionate about technology and the ways stuff gets built. From webapps, deep learning, hashing algorithms, to video encoding protocols and financial markets. My path is quite a divergent one, which makes me skilled in a wide range of technologies. I tend to work in positions where I can learn. My main strength is learning on the spot and finding fast solutions. My main weakness is delegating tasks and communicating my process.</title>
