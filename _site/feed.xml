Passionate about technology and the ways stuff gets built.  From webapps, deep learning, hashing algorithms, to video encoding protocols  and financial markets. My path is quite a divergent one, which makes me skilled  in a wide range of technologies. I tend to work in positions where I can learn.  Personality: My main strength is learning on the spot and finding fast solutions.  On the other hand, It has been difficult for me to ask for help when I need it.</subtitle><author><name>Ian Mihura</name></author></feed>
