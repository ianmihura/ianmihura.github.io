The man-eating, gold-hoarding, treacherous Gibbelins first appear in the short story ["The Hoard of the Gibbelins"](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7477/7477-h/7477-h.htm#THE_HOARD_OF_THE_GIBBELINS), by Lord Dunsany (1912), wherein ambitious Alderic seeks (and fails) to rob the Enemy of their gold. He is not the first knight to try, but his plan differs greatly: he captures a dragon and rides it to their layer. He then swims, spends the night breaking into the tower with a mighty pickaxe, and finds the gems. Unfortunately the Gibbelins immediately find, capture, and kill him.

"The Demise of the Gibbelins" starts off right after this adventure, when the ill-fated news arrives in the town of Alderic.
